**Aim**

* speech recoginition is difficult since there are ambiguities
* how to differentiate:
	* context of conversation
	* invading a nice beach in normandy xd
	* likeliness of phrases
* in ai there's constant probability of phrases and **never** certainties
* jeopardy is a hard game to play for AI since there are incorrect spelling, cultural references, jokes, etc.
* years for special taxis to even be avialable: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 15
* taxi regular: 10, 30
* buy a driverless hybrid car: 10, 30
* there are a lot of implications for driverless cars:
	* jobs will be lost
	* new method of driving since AI dont need street lights etc
	* car insurance changes
	* people waiting for transplants will be lost since there are less accidents
	* many interesting/unintended effects

**Aim**: What is AI?

* machine learning
* google's deep dreams
* games
* turing test
* self-driving cars
* facial recognition
* recommendation engines
* netflix(it costs them money for them to send you bandwidth. why?)
	* using YOU as a recommendation engine
	* so you dont cancel subscription
* behind **all** AI products(behind the scenes) is *money*. This drives AI behind the scenes
* in games big news:
	* **2016**: alphago, deep mind
		* trained over vast quantities of games, find patterns that lead to winning
	* **2017**: alphagoZero
		* completely different(no human games)
		* given the rules for Go, and was told to play itself
		* within 4 days, it beat alphago
		* we're talking about billions of games
	* **2017**: alphaZero
		* a question: can AI learn multiple games and master them?
		* alphaZero beat alphagoZero within 10 hours, and mastered not only Go but chess as well
	* woke up China to the capabilities on AI when AI beat a Go player
* machines
	* high number of calculations
	* Chinese can start doing pattern recognition soon b/c they're doing their social credit score(like credit score)
	* vast amounts of info has been collected by Chinese gov and corporations to model consumption behavior(also **Amazon**)
* humans
	* high level pattern recognition(though recently machines can start doing this)
* Amazon will be collecting the most data from users
* facial recognition is important since it can be used as surveillance(this is why money is going into this)
